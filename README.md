# myRecipe

myRecipe is a web application that allows users to try out different cusinies, mostly homemade, by making them. I wanted the user to be able to  incorporate a backstory, or origin, to the recipe they upload. My parents are from the state of Punjab in India, and growing up eating Punjabi food almost every day, they always had a story from their childhood that related to the food we were eating that day. This connection to thier upbringing allowed me to connect to my culture, so I wanted to have this idea as an important aspect of the application.

## Planned Additions 
  1) User can categorize the food by cuisine (Indian, Chinese, Italian, etc)
  2) User can favorite a recipe 
  3) User can comment on a recipe uploaded by a different user 


## What I learned 
  1) I learned how helpul it can be to plan very well and try to anticipate where I will struggle before I write even a single line of code
  2) How to make a dynamic form, in this case for the recipe ingredients, where the user can add as many ingredients as they need to make the recipe
  3) The benefits of the map function, espicially when rendering the recipe list to the page
  4) How to effectively work with state, especially objects or arrays nested in state, and it is vital that it is not mutated in any way when trying to acess something inside it
